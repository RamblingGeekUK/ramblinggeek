excerpt: Storing Electronics Project, in a manageable way
---

### The Problem?

Have you ever setup a breadboard, RaspberryPi, ESP32, Pico on the workbench... made a circut... 
but then want to move it to make space for another project, it can be a nighhtmare, cables popping out... 
having to figure out what's popped out and put it back... I was using a peiece of cardboard, until an Idea struck me, what if there was a better way?

### The Solution?

I use and love the GridFinity system created by [Zack Freedman] (https://www.youtube.com/@ZackFreedman), which has since exploded with designs, 
Fusion add-ons, websites, etc.

I have made 5x5, approx. 200mm x 200mm, plate, with a steel plate.  This allows the GridFinity bins with magnets installed to stick to the plate, allowing projects
to remain setup and easily moved or stored.

This is an early version.  I intend on creating a method of stacking the project boards, so that they can be put away when not in use.
