### The Problem?

Have you ever setup a breadboard, RaspberryPi, ESP32, Pico on the workbench... made a circut... 
but then want to move it to make space for another project, it can be a nighhtmare, cables popping out... 
having to figure out what's popped out and put it back... I was using a peiece of cardboard, until an Idea struck me, what if there was a better way?

### The Solution?

I use and love the GridFinity system created by Zack Freemen, Google it if you haven't heard of it.  It's amazing.
